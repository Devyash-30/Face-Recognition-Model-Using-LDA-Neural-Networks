# Face-Recognition-Model-Using-LDA-Neural-Networks
Overview
This project showcases the implementation of machine learning algorithms, particularly Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), combined with neural network techniques to develop a robust face recognition system.

Features
Machine Learning Implementation: The system leverages the power of LDA for dimensionality reduction, which helps in enhancing the recognition rates.
Neural Network Techniques: Post LDA, a neural network is utilized to improve the feature extraction process and categorize the images efficiently.
Self Authentication: The system was trained and tested with images of my face to successfully recognize and authenticate.
Masked Face Recognition: Conducted experiments using images both with and without masks. This feature ensures that the system remains functional in real-world scenarios, especially in times when face coverings are common.
