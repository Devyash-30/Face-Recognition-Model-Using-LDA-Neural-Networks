# Face-Recognition-Model-Using-LDA-Neural-Networks

This project showcases the implementation of machine learning algorithms, particularly Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), combined with neural network techniques to develop a robust face recognition system.

The system was trained and tested with images of my face to successfully recognize and authenticate. The system leverages the power of LDA for dimensionality reduction, which helps in enhancing the recognition rates. Post LDA, a neural network is utilized to improve the feature extraction process and categorize the images efficiently.

Conducted experiments using images both with and without masks. This feature ensures that the system remains functional in real-world scenarios, especially in times when face coverings are common.
